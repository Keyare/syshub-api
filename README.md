# SYShub Project

SYShub is a voting and proposal portal for the Syscoin Platform governance system. 
Every 48000 blocks there is an allocation of Syscoin to succesful proposals.
These proposals are for new or continuing development, partnerships or other activities that improve the Syscoin protocol.

The SYShub portal at https://syshub.org allows masternode owners to:
- Vote on Proposals

It also allows non-masternode holders to:
- Submit Proposals
- View proposals
- Monitor voting, payout dates, price, number of masternodes online and more.

To register your masternodes, go to https://syshub.org and sign up. 
 - Go to MASTERNODE SETTINGS and enter the required masternode details using the form -OR-
 - Go to MULTIPLE ADD, copy the contents of your masternode.conf file in the box and push ADD ALL.  This will register ALL your msternodes automatically.
